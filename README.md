## Install :wrench:

You clone the repo and run ``yarn`` and that's it. It still early, but it will be GREAT.

*NOTE: When other features come into effect, such as database setup, I will be updating this install section.*

## Usage

The plan is: you go, take the template and do your thing. In ten minutes you see that simple structure and start your simple project. This humble template is _NOT_ intended for large projects, you could start with it and than do some refactor to a design pattern down the road. But for small projects that we do to get some XP, it will be perfect.

## Roadmap

Working on it...But the plan is something like that:

## Contributing :heart:

Feel free to use this template or propose some goodies for it. After all it is all public.
